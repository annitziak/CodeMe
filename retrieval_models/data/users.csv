2.  A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be  is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me  and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be,  so that It is I  became It is me.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to this random assortment of facts.</p>

<p>I have been developing software for a long time. I also manage software projects. I enjoy both the tactical aspect of writing code as well as the strategic aspect of keeping the customer happy, the development team happy and building software that will Do Something Useful.</p>

<h2>Industries I've Worked</h2>

<p>IT is everywhere! Most industries are very similar when it comes to employee needs, although one might think they're very different. I've seen Financial Traders get just as worked up and panicked as Healthcare Staff when their systems aren't working properly. My job is to make it so whatever the user wants to do is <em>EASY</em> and, in effect, so that they don't even notice me.*</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Process Improvement,</li>
<li>Chemical,</li>
<li>Education,</li>
<li>Energy (oil, gas, &amp; electricity),</li>
<li>Entertainment,</li>
<li>Financial,</li>
<li>Healthcare,</li>
<li>Marketing,</li>
<li>Media,</li>
<li>Property Management, and</li>
<li>Software (the company's actual product)

<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile (Android + IOS) App Development</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite OS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mac OSX is my primary (the command line rocks for unleashing the power of bash)</li>
<li>Debian for regular server</li>
<li><strike>Windows</strike> <strike>XBox</strike> PS4 for the games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preferred Browsers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chrome, hands down</li>
<li>Firefox, if you're nasty</li>
<li>Safari, if I must</li>
<li>IE if you want me to hate my job</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Languages</h2>

<p>There isn't really a favorite, just languages that are better suited for a particular task/application. I want to <strong>use the best tool for the job</strong>, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument"" rel=""nofollow"">not everything is a nail</a>.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
I can be contacted through <a href=""https://mailhide.io/e/xK6Ya"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this reCAPTCHA</a> (requires JavaScript to be allowed from <em>google.com</em> and possibly other(s)). Make sure to make the subject <em>specific</em> (I said: <strong><em>specific</em></strong>. Repeat: <strong>specific</strong> subject required). I can not stress this enough - 90% of you can not compose a specific subject, but instead use some generic subject. <i><b>Use a specific subject, damn it!</b></i> You still don't get it. It can't be that difficult to provide a specific subject to an email instead of a generic one. For example, including meta content like ""quick question"" is unhelpful. Concentrate on the actual subject. Did I say 
<i>specific</i>? I think I did. Let me repeat it just in case: use a <i>specific</i> subject in your email (otherwise it will no be opened at all).

<p>&quot;You need to realize that when you practice from the state of the
beginner all the way to the stage of immutable wisdom, then you must
go back to the status of the beginner again.</p>
<p>""Let me explain in terms of *programming*. As a beginner you know nothing of *statements* or *regular expressions*, so you have nothing in yourself
to dwell on mentally. If someone asks you to *program*, you just *program*
without thinking of anything. 
<p>""Then, when you learn various things like *classes*, how to wield a *regular expression*, where to place your attention, and so on, your
mind lingers on various points, so you find yourself all tangled up
when you try to *code*. 
<p>""But if you practice day after day and month after month, eventually *statements* and *structure* don't hang on your mind anymore,
and you are like a beginner who knows nothing.""

<p>I'm a software developer who relishes authoring HTML and CSS on the web and hacking C# on their self-built Windows PC. I adore Jesus and the colors green, purple and teal, and I often catch myself thinking in numbers and code on a whim. I was also a <a href=""https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002751"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft MVP</a> from 2017 through 2020.</p>
<p>My areas of specialty are in web design — I've known HTML and CSS for more than a decade now! — and Windows app development with C# and XAML. Other languages I've worked with include (from most to least experience) PHP, SQL, ActionScript, Swift, Objective-C, Perl, Python, and Java.</p>
<h2>Roles on this site</h2>
<p>From the tags I participate in (below) as well as my bio (above), it's easy to tell that I'm interested in a number of languages and topics. However, you'll most often find me patrolling, curating and moderating the following tags:</p>
<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/html"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;"" rel=""tag"">html</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/css-selectors"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;css-selectors&#39;"" rel=""tag"">css-selectors</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/internet-explorer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;internet-explorer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">internet-explorer</a><a href=""/questions/tagged/microsoft-edge"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;microsoft-edge&#39;"" rel=""tag"">microsoft-edge</a></p>
<p>As a moderator, I believe I am more efficient than ever with post revisions and other housekeeping duties, as I continue with my question-answering business. While I actively add fresh content to the site, I'm also helping out with cleaning and polishing our currently-existing posts. &quot;Dust tends to settle&quot;, and all that jazz.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>From 2008 through 2021, Mark wrote a series of books on Android app development. These books are now available for free download from <a href=""https://commonsware.com/catalog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the CommonsWare site</a>.</p>
<p>His most recent books have been focused on second-generation Android app development (Kotlin and the Android Jetpack):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Jetpack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android Jetpack</em></a>, a new introductory book on Android app development, focused on second-generation techniques.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndExplore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Exploring Android</em></a>, a series of step-by-step tutorials for building an Android app from scratch. This book demonstrates app development using Kotlin, coroutines, and the Jetpack libraries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Room"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android Room</em></a>, to help you incorporate Google's reactive object wrapper around SQLite.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android R</em></a>, to help you deal with the changes introduced by Android 11 (code-named &quot;R&quot;). It covers everything from scoped storage changes to data access auditing to sharing UIs between apps to bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Kotlin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Kotlin</em></a>, a guide to the Kotlin programming language, which is rapidly gaining in popularity for Android app development.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Coroutines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Kotlin Coroutines</em></a>, exploring Kotlin's new
first-class reactive programming system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning, Android development was focused on Java and, partially, on the Android Support Library. Mark's earliest books share that focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Android"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</em></a>, the first and largest book on Android app programming</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndroidArch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Android's Architecture Components</em></a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/GraphQL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>GraphQL and Android</em></a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry, but I don't do <strong>chat</strong>.  Software development is a knowledge exercise, that requires concentration, and a lack of interruptions, to do well.  <em>Chat</em> forces constant context-switching, and loss of efficiency as a result of these interruptions.  I post on Stack Overflow in my free time, when I've already been interrupted for other reasons, but I can't spare the time to hang around in chat rooms.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</p>
<p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</p>

Golang, JavaScript on Node.js, etc.), NoSQL (with Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB, etc.), and cloud platforms (mainly AWS and IBM Cloud a.k.a.

<p>Kenji likes working in a UNIX environment, partly because he makes heavy use of the command line.

<p>Anyway. I'm just your typical web developer.  PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, the works.</p>
<p>I usually hang out at <code>/home/nticompass</code>.  Sometimes I'll <code>cd</code> to other folders, but I usually just chill at home.  I like to hang with my friends at <code>/usr/share</code>, or sometimes even <code>/opt</code>, when I'm feeling adventurous.</p>
<p>My shell is zsh and my editor of choice is Geany, when I want a GUI, or Vim, when I don't.  I use Google Chrome, and sometimes Firefox.</p>

<p>I discovered StackOverflow after realizing that Yahoo Answers wasn't taking it seriously and Experts Exchange made you pay for answers.  I love to answer questions and help people out and I am so grateful to those who have answered my questions.

<p>As <a href=""http://xsltransform.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://xsltransform.net/</a> never got updated to newer Saxon versions and especially Saxon 9.8 (the first Saxon version to support the XSLT 3 spec finalized in June 2017) I have set up <a href=""https://xsltfiddle.liberty-development.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://xsltfiddle.liberty-development.net/</a> which uses the .NET version of Saxon HE (now using the latest version 10 available for .NET framework) to allow testing and sharing XSLT 3 samples. Due to various problems with excessive/abusive db use I have suspended the db based fiddle but you can continue to use various XSLT processors at <a href=""https://xsltfiddle-beta.liberty-development.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://xsltfiddle-beta.liberty-development.net/</a>.</p>
<p>With SaxonJS 2 also allowing direct XSLT 3.0 execution in the browser with the help of the <code>fn:transform</code> XPath 3.1 function I have furthermore created a <a href=""https://martin-honnen.github.io/xslt3fiddle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pure browser based XSLT 3 fiddle</a>, needing no backend. Also available as a <a href=""https://martin-honnen.github.io/xslt3fiddlePWA/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PWA</a>, to allow cross-platform offline installation.</p>
<p>As Saxonica so far has only created the enterprise level, commercial SaxonCS for XSLT 3.0, XPath 3.1 and XQuery 3.1 under .NET Core aka .NET 6 or later, I have tried to create an open-source sucessor of Saxon-HE for .NET Core aka .NET 6 or later, using IKVM to cross-compile the Saxon HE 11 or 12 Java releases to .NET and have produced a couple of dotnet command line tools and libraries that allow the use of XSLT 3.0, XPath 3.1 and XQuery 3.1 under MPL 2.0 with .NET 6 aka .NET core:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.nuget.org/packages/SaxonHE11NetXslt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSLT 3.0 dotnet command line tool based on Saxon HE Java 11</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.nuget.org/packages/SaxonHE11NetXQuery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XQuery 3.1 dotnet command line tool based on Saxon HE Java 11</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://www.nuget.org/packages/SaxonHE12NetXQuery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XQuery 3.1 dotnet command line tool based on Saxon HE Java 12</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the CheerpJ 3 (currently available as a release candidate) Java to JavaScript/web assembly runtime I have also managed to run Saxon HE 11 Java in the browser, a browser based fiddle is at <a href=""https://martin-honnen.github.io/cheerpj-saxon-worker/index-workbench.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://martin-honnen.github.io/cheerpj-saxon-worker/index-workbench.html</a>.

I am passionate about the reusability of the software I develop - I have found that continually building tools for my team rather than simply solving the particular problem at hand is the key to accelerating future work and success.</p>

<p>If you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming. By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've learned something about it yourself. —Douglas Adams</p>

In the late 80s and early 90s, I was involved in early modeling and code generation tools that reached the marketplace, including a tool that modeled FORTRAN programs and generated FORTRAN for parallel supercomputer architectures, and a tool that managed Shlaer-Mellor models and generated C++ code. Over the years, I have applied Shlaer-Mellor, UML, and custom modeling and various code generation techniques to greatly benefit the development of enterprise applications.</p>

<p>My current passion and endeavor is to foster the evolution of model oriented development.  In particular, I am passionate about evolving the Mo+ model oriented programming language and related model driven development tools, with as much community input as possible to achieve higher levels in the ability to create and maintain code.

<p>A group of inadequate Rubyists teaming with SO moderators are stalking me and abusing their privileges to delete all my content without a reason. When I have managed to make one moderator follow the rules, in revenge thay randomly chose one old answer of mine and collectively downvoted it 5 times within minutes -- I flagged that but moderators ignored it, same as they have ignored all the rest of my flags. Because they are the same team. Toxic community of ungrateful inadequate people who censor me and delete my content just because I responsibly follow the official rules of SO that they don't follow. They are blatantly violating multiple SO rules, they are collectively stalking, downvoting and deleting random answers of mine just to show that nothing can stop them because they are moderators. Such behaviour isn't professional, it is disgusting and shameful. They are such mean people that even write insults on me in comments. When I flags insults the flags get ignored. No matter what is written in rules of SO they don't work because moderators are promoting different rules -- such that allow people to insult you in comments, calling you bad words, saying that you are handicapped and other things. Moderators refuse to remove such comments and if you create a post in Meta to highlight the problem, instead of acting and fixing it they only write even more insults on you -- the Meta website is a trap place where they call you to come to throw even more trash on you, publicly insult and demean you. Do not believe moderators -- they always lie and censor everything that would expose it.</p>

<p><strong>Noteworthy Accomplishments</strong></p>

<p>.NET-like framework for native C++ with <em>precise</em> generational mark-and-sweep GC <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2009/12/precise-garbage-collector-for-c-builder.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a> which gives better performance than boost::shared_ptr especially in multithreaded apps. Speed difference is most profound on server boxes with multiple CPUs. I've also created a similar library for GCC - <a href=""http://managedcpp.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Managed C++ for GCC (MCP)</a>.</p>

<p>Also found several C# language design oversights <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2010/05/anonymous-methods-lambda-expression.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a> causing weird and undesired side effects to programmers, as well as numerous framework bugs <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2008/07/dotnuts-framework-directoryinfogetfiles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a> <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2010/07/net-serialport-woes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[2]</a> <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2011/07/streamreaderpeek-can-block-another-net.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[3]</a> (that's to be expected considering the size of the framework).</p>

<p>But the biggest of all, finding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64#Incompatible_applications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a critical bug in WOW64</a>. Microsoft OS team <a href=""http://blog.zachsaw.com/2010/11/wow64-bug-getthreadcontext-may-return.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stuffed up the WOW64 design</a> of their Windows OS during the design phase of Windows XP x64. They've said it's too costly to change now (design flaws are always the most costly) and would perhaps try to fix it for Windows 8 (we'll see about that). I was surprised that the bug went unnoticed by the brightest people (Boehm GC guys would've seen it for sure) in the world for 11 years before I came along and root caused it in about a day.</p>

<p>Computers have always been a big part of my life.  I've always had an interest in programming paradigms and languages as well as low-level systems design.  I enjoy reinventing the wheel, chrome plating it and adding spinners.  I also love to know how everything works from the code that we write, the systems it runs on, and the hardware this is run on.  I want to know it all.  I have no problem building out tools to help make problems I come across a lot easier to deal with.  C# is my language of choice and aim to be sufficiently familiar with all related technologies.  And with the growth that has been sparked ever since the development of the newer Roslyn compilers, my love for it has no bounds.</p>

Along this same line I'd say I'm a pretty humble guy, never liked to toot my own horn; whenever someone tells me that I'm doing something good, did a great job or I'm a genius (for some reason) I tend to stare them down and tell them ""don't lie to me"", guess that as well keeps me in a state in which I'm always thriving to learn more and better myself.</p>

<p>My third great love (besides programming and cooking), are videogames, both to play and (attempt to) make. I love this so much that I tried to get as many other people as I could into it, that's why I started an elective course on game design and development at my university, and I'm proud to say it's full every single semester.</p>

<p>I also enjoy reading comics and graphic novels, fantasy and sci-fi books, good wine and cigars.</p>

<h2>Main interests</h2>
<p>I really like programming and developing stuff. My main focus in web application development and testing. Among the technologies I am passionate about, you can find: <em>ASP.NET</em>, <em>.NET</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>VB.NET</em>, <em>WCF</em>, <em>C/C++</em> (all hail Bjarne), <em>Boost C++ Library</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Javascript</em> + dialects (<em>Typescript</em>, etc.), <em>HTML5</em>, CSS + dialects (<em>SASS</em>, <em>LESS</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>I have a lot of interests in Mathematics as well. Among engineering technologies, I really like working with: <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, Wolfram Language, <a href=""http://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matlab</a>.</p>
<p>I also like creating graphics, animations and presentation using the most popular applications in the <em>Adobe</em> families (I saw <em>Flash</em> growing since when it was still a baby, 5.0, and it was still <em>Macromedia</em>, RIP).</p>
<h2>(Human) Languages</h2>
<p>I like travelling a lot, and the best part of travelling is experiencing new languages, new sounds new people and culture. I actually love Asia. I lived in Japan and worked there. Made also a lot of friends and gonna return there soon (I hope). I can speak Italian, English, Japanese and still learning this fancy language called Danish.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>I also like sports. I practiced many but now I almost focused my entire life on <strong>swimming</strong> and <strong>open water swimming</strong>. Now I made a full transition to <strong>diving</strong> (no <em>scuba</em>!).</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I also like photography, reading lots of books, food (strange food) and music. But most of all I like sharing knowledge with other people. More knowledge in the world means a better world! That's why I am #SOreadytohelp!</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please read [ask].

A question that is suitable for Stack Overflow is one where you have already figured out the **specific part** of the code that does something different from what you expect (and you should concretely *expect something*), and don't understand why.

<p>For no-effort &quot;do my homework for me&quot; (basically always &quot;needs more focus&quot;):</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please read [ask] and [How do I ask and answer homework questions?](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/334822/). We will not write code to specification for you here. Plagiarism is a serious academic offense; aside from that, we require a **specific** question - which will come out of your best attempt to [understand](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/261592/) and analyze the task, identify the logical steps to solve the problem, and figure out *where you are actually stuck*. Make sure to check if the issue is already addressed in another question.
</code></pre>
<p>To answer &quot;Can you help me?&quot;</p>
<pre><code>It [is not possible to &quot;help you&quot;](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/284236/) here as this is **not a discussion forum**.
</code></pre>
<p>For questions and answers that make inappropriate use of <code>eval</code> and/or <code>exec</code> in Python:</p>
<pre><code>**[Do not ever use `eval` (or `exec`) on data that could possibly come from outside the program in any form. It is a critical security risk. You allow the author of the data to run arbitrary code on your computer](/q/1832940). It [cannot easily be sandboxed, and proper sandboxing is harder than using a proper tool for the job.](/q/3068139)**
</code></pre>
<p>For attempts to use Python 2.7 for new code:</p>
<pre><code>Please keep in mind that Python 2.7 has been **unmaintained, even for essential security fixes, since Jan 1, 2020**. It is approximately as old as Windows 7. If Python 2.7 came with your computer then **do not attempt to remove it, as this can seriously damage your operating system**; but please try to write code for an up-to-date Python version, make sure you have one installed, and make sure you can enforce that the code runs with that version instead.

<p>&quot;<em>We cannot answer every correct question - but we can often answer questions which are not correctly asked, by first giving them a form in which they have a meaning. Often the process of reformulating the question and giving the answer is the same process. Looking for answers, we discover new meanings and find out what it was that we were asking for. This is the scientific approach. Do not expect answers before you have found clear meanings. But do not throw away unclear questions. Keep them on file until you have the means at the same time to clarify and to answer them.</em>&quot; - Hans Reichenbach, &quot;<strong>The Direction of Time</strong>&quot;</p>

I've developed in Java for as long as the language exists (Kotlin is looking good too). I consider myself a polyglot though, and have learned many computer languages since my Computer Science study.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the Crypto site I pride myself in giving easy to understand answers on questions relatively low on math. I'll never match the mathematical prowess of some of my peers, but a more practical answer is often called for. And as my picture indicates there isn't that much that escapes my attention. This also results in a relatively high amount of comments and edits. As of 2018 I got elected as moderator on the crypto site - which mainly means I have to keep re-evaluating myself, especially when it comes to closing questions.</p>

Well, let's say starting then I always tried to expand my knowledge. While I still am not a typical wizard at some topic, I believe I have collected a fair amount of knowledge over various areas. </p>

<p>These includes all of the three major desktop operating systems being used those days (with Windows being the least favored one and all Linux distributions counted as one single systems), as well as quite a lot of programming languages. </p>

<p>In my later years I decided to study mathematics, which helped me to sharpen my logical reasoning and develop a toolset of problem solving methods.</p>

<p>In 2011 I finished my M. Sc. in Maths and started working as a data- and process analyst at one of Germany's major companies. </p>

<p>In parallel I am working part-time on my PhD, researching one practical application for B-Splines and the methods that can be used for that. </p>

<p>Right now the languages and applications I use frequently are MATLAB, R and C++, as well as LaTeX, if one wants to call that a programming language (well, it's Turing-complete, isn't it?). Furthermore, I started getting used to Emacs and loving it - here, though, I'm only scratching on the surface.</p>

<p>I'm quite lazy, which means that I need to automate everything that is repetitive and/or dull (I'm a Maven lover!

Throughout my PhD years, I've published around 20 papers in top conferences and journals. I was also a winner of the Microsoft Research Fellowship in the year 2009.</p>

<p>I also enjoy competitive programming a lot. I was a regular contestant in programming contests like acm/icpc, Google Code Jam and TopCoder Open. I've also won awards and top prizes from these competitions.</p>

There were quite a few repetitive computer tasks going on and I felt there must be a better way to do some of the things being done. There was one job in particular where somebody would spend a couple of hours each week copying addresses from an Excel spreadsheet after looking up VAT numbers in another. I was able to write a script to automate this and as a result the two-hour-a-week job now only takes two minutes.</p>

<p>A lot of the things that I write are written in AutoHotkey. Designed primarily for automating keystrokes and mouse clicks it’s also a pretty powerful (yet incredibly simple) scripting language for Windows with an active community on its forums. As well as the already mentioned keystrokes and mouse clicks it can also be used to generate simple UIs, read and write text files and the Windows registry, parse strings, loop through files and folders and many other things. Extra libraries are available in the forums thanks to various fantastic people that add support for things such as accessing COM interfaces and the Windows GDI. For a simple language it is capable of quite a bit and is my go-to language for quick jobs.</p>

<p>I have also recently started to learn Python and am really liking it. Pretty much anything is possible and it is a pleasure to write in.</p>

<p>At DoX, I was part of a small development team developing a plugin-based framework from scratch in Java SE, where I gained most of my experience with Java and framework design/development.</p>
<p>At Ultramain, I was the team leader of the framework team, where we developed new features for the Java EE/JWS based system here. The whole system was processed dynamically using XML-specified views, DTOs, DAOs, validators, etc. written by business developers, and operated on top of JBoss, Hibernate, and Swing.</p>
<p>At SambaSafety, I started as a software engineer on Java and Groovy systems built primarily on Spring 3/4/Boot, Grails, JMS, and REST. I also did off-and-on scrum mastering for our scrum development cycles, a role that fit well with my team lead experience at Ultramain. I was promoted to Software Architect, where I coordinated between the product and engineering teams to design integration patterns between systems in a polyglot platform to create a unified, data-driven application.</p>
<p>At Crisp, I bring my architecture and data analytics experience from SambaSafety to bear, spearheading the effort to move the company's main product from a forecasting system to a data aggregation and analytics platform. Here, I gained experience with Google Cloud Platform (as a whole), Kubernetes, Kotlin, Selenium, APIs across multiple retailer platforms, GCS, BigQuery, GCP monitoring (formerly known as Stackdriver), Prometheus, Grafana, Pub/Sub, GraphQL APIs (includes writing servers, clients, and setting up a federated Apollo gateway), gRPC, and more. After becoming the de facto team lead of my team, we're going continue growing the platform into an enterprise-ready platform to meet scalability and compliance requirements as we grow as a company.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer and architect at Volkswagen Group of America. I write cool software and deal with special under-the-radar projects. </p>

<p>I have been programming for something like 20+ years. I started in your typical languages, and moving into the web-space during the height of the browser wars. I have written code in these languages and many more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic (Yay basic!)</li>
<li>Turbo Pascal</li>
<li>Fortran</li>
<li>COBOL</li>
<li>ColdFusion</li>
<li>HTML (I have run into a few people that argue it is a language. Although my argument is always that it's a markup language, not logic - but it is argued, so it makes the list)</li>
<li>JavaScript (because.)</li>
<li>PHP (Keep your jokes to yourself, everyone makes the leap somewhere)</li>
<li>Java </li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>C++ (It was college)</li>
<li>ASM (never again)</li>
</ul>

<p>That my non-exhaustive list of languages that I remember working with. There are probably more.</p>

<p>So aside from programming languages, I have also worked with the following dialects, scripting, markups, whatever:</p>

<ul>
<li>XML/XSLT</li>
<li>HTML4,5/XHTML</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>SQL [MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL]</li>
<li>CSS (Yay!)</li>
</ul>

<p>JavaScript Frameworks: React, Angular
JavaScript Frontend Libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap, and a bunch of ones that showed up in the early to mid 2000's.</p>

It wasn't a &quot;Hello World&quot; application but a full-fledged, web-based learning management system. This exposure galvanized my career choice and prepared me to face a myriad of challenges head-on. My unconventional start continues to yield tangible successes in nearly every discipline I touch, whether on the technical, operational, or business level.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been on a mission to make technology work seamlessly and feel invisible. I have delivered this continued success with a daily, sleeves-rolled-up approach. Whenever my superiors need their most complex projects to be built and flawlessly delivered, they ask my team. I keep a good rapport with my colleges and managers so that working as a team is flawless. Their confidence in me has enabled me to be at the forefront of the engineering and design efforts necessary to bring applications from 0 to over 600k users.</p>
<p>Building projects of this quality becomes a craft. The concepts I've worked to develop, discover, and distill have worked so well that they <a href=""https://go.oliverspryn.com/writing-a-fully-unit-testable-android-app-droidcon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have been featured on the droidcon blog</a>, home of Europe's foremost Android conference.</p>
<p>Whether my work is published on a prominent blog or neatly packed inside of some back-end service, I ensure that I conduct each of these projects with my full measure of integrity. This trait is essential in delivering healthy projects on time, and it sets the good projects apart from the great ones.</p>

<p>After much consideration, I have decided to retire this account. While I will continue to vote on interesting questions and answers, as well as occasionally update my own answers, I believe it is time to make way for a new generation of tech enthusiasts to answer questions. If you wish to connect with me, you can find me on LinkedIn at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaccioly/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaccioly/</a> or Mastodon at <a href=""https://accioly.social/@anthony"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://accioly.social/@anthony</a>.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful to Stack Overflow for providing numerous opportunities for professional growth that directly or indirectly stemmed from my contributions to the community. This website has been instrumental in shaping my journey, and I owe much of my current success to its platform.</p>
<p>Thank you, Stack Overflow, for the incredible journey and the invaluable support along the way.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm a developer with a solid experience in building scalable / distributed / cloud-native / enterprise applications in the JVM ecosystem. Currently, I'm working as a Senior Lead Architect at <a href=""https://www.citigroup.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Citi</a> and striving to take my own company <a href=""https://www.7rtc.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7RTC</a> off the ground.</p>
<p>With almost two decades of experience in software development, I've contributed to several exciting projects. For instance, my most recent project was a multi-cloud blockchain-enabled open account automation system written in Kotlin.</p>
<p>A lifetime ago I worked at Ericsson, where I led a team that developed a new-generation Network Manager used by ISPs to run 3G, 4G and 5G Networks using &quot;cutting-edge&quot; technology of its time (2015/2016), such as Java EE 7, JBoss EAP 7, Apache Camel, and OpenStack.
If this is not old enough for you, two lifetimes ago I was a &quot;Sun Certified Java Programmer&quot; building enterprise solutions with BEA products such as WebLogic Portal &amp; WebLogic Integration.</p>
<p>Apart from building applications, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge with others. You may often find me giving or organising talks, mentoring new developers, and promoting the benefits of Extreme Programming, TDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and Event-driven architecture. I also frequently write about Agile, Developer Experience, the tech job market, my experience as an immigrant, as well as other random musings on social media.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm an unwaveringly nerdy student with outstanding grades and a research grant since my undergraduate days. I've never stopped attending lectures and conferences, and I occasionally lecture myself.</p>

<p>I prefer to grow software (constructing is the wrong metaphor) organically, test-driven and clean, with a lot of automation and supporting tools, which are best shared and collaboratively improved as open source. Like gardening, you need to take a long-term view, consider the seasons and surroundings to write beautiful, lasting applications.</p>

<p>Now they have <code>next(takewhile(not_, count()))</code> problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since I've been asked about this multiple times now:</p>

<p>It's a reference to <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Now they have two problems""</a> about regular expressions. <code>next(takewhile(not_, count()))</code> is guaranteed to give you <code>0</code>, and pretty efficiently… but it's not exactly readable. Which is the joke. <code>itertools</code> <em>does</em> solve all your problems, but you don't <em>always</em> need to use it.</p>

<p>If you don't grasp the paradigm, go read <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">David Beazley's presentations</a>. Once you do: ""I've got a CSV, and I want to group the rows by…"" Pass a <code>csv.reader</code> to <code>groupby</code>. ""I've got a bunch of values, and I want to take them 4 at a time and…"" Use <code>grouper</code> from the recipes. ""I've got a file, and I want to take each pair of adjacent lines and…"" <code>tee</code> it, <code>next</code> one copy, and <code>zip</code> them. And so on.</p>

<p>But of course some problems have an even <em>easier</em> solution, and once you start thinking in terms of sequences of transformations on iterators, sometimes you'll miss the easier answer.</p>

<p>(The exact same thing happens with <code>numpy</code>, of course.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple
ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple
ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are
made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or
complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to
take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by
which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating
them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real
existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general
ideas are made.</p>

<p>As I look at the last 10 years, I see that I did quite a lot of work all kinds of computers. From fiddling with microcontrollers and assembler code to writing data processing scripts to physically assembling computer consoles.</p>

<p>The big step forward came when I <strong>learned to think about software in a structured, object-oriented way</strong>, as this allowed me to make software do things that I want it to do. Right now I'm <strong>proficient in two high level programming languages</strong> - Objective-C and Java and have touched just about every framework available for iOS. I've also became a hacker/maker and have completed a number of projects involving software and hardware.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in my early 30s and when I ask myself <strong>""What would I like to do in the next 10 years?""</strong>, my answer is ""something with the human brain"". The seeds are already there - I've picked up an interest in biology, cognitive science and neuroscience, enough to converse with real people. I've done first-hand research into sleep and made discoveries. I've taken classes in synthetic biology, performing manipulations on the bacteria genome. I've learned a lot about the neurotransmitter systems of the human brain, as well as how a biological organism develops.</p>

<p>It seems like there are a lot of similarities between the object-oriented concepts I use in the daily programming tasks and how biological organisms operate. This makes me hopeful that by the time I'm in my late 30s, I would be able to work and program some form of biological computer or just plain hack the human brain.</p>

I also co-founded <a href=""https://codelaboratories.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CodeLaboratories</a>, which has been doing some amazing boutique software and hardware R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty five years, I have developed just about everything—from shiny user interfaces to low-level kernel drivers. I've worked on scaling blockchains systems, developed consensus algorithms, coded servers that handle tens of thousands of users, created kernel and BIOS drivers to optimize HDD and SSD perfromance, and worked on early iterations of encrypted distributed storage and backup systems.</p>
<h4>My Interests</h4>
<p>My interests are diverse. Currently I'm focused on cryptography, security, software integrity and protection and secure computing and storage.</p>

I believe the key to writing good software is collaborating and thinking through the problem. After that all that's left is how you tell the computer to execute your implementation. A good software developer can turn their hand to any language once they realise that is the medium used to implement their solution.</p>

<p>During my career so far I've built up a lot of experience working with very high volume transactional websites (at big name companies such as easyJet, Asos, Nasdaq and Play.com). This has given me valuable experience on how to write fast, maintainable and scalable code.</p>

<p>I am a practitioner of the BDD (Behavioural Driven Development) approach where possible or at the very least a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. I don't know how people can write software without a specification or at the very least a test. Without this how do they know what they are writing their software to do? Writing, investigating and talking through the Spec(s)/test(s) first gives you a clear vision of what the software needs to do. Bolting the tests on after the fact (or in the worst case not at all) always leads to a more long winded and buggy solution.</p>

<p>For most of my career I have worked using the Agile Scrum methodology. I really like this way of working as it gives the software team a visible achievable goal each sprint. It also allows the business to react to an ever changing market (and often requirements).</p>

Since February 2014, <strong>Ukraine has been suffering from Russia's armed invasion</strong> and attempted occupation.<br />
14,000 civillians <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/4r766hmm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">killed</a> Feb/2014-Feb/2022.<br />
100,000 <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2rtefz22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">killed</a> after the full-scale invasion on Feb/2022, incl. <strong>mass murders</strong> in <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/mpntn4zk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bucha</a> and <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/zddye26y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mariupol</a>.<br />
<strong>1,900,000 forcibly deported</strong> to russia, incl <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/yc6v7bca"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">300,000 children</a>.<br />
6,900,000 refugees recorded across Europe.<br />
8,000,000 more internally displaced.</p>
<p>Invading Ukraine, however, is not the final goal for the Russian war in Europe. Their officials said numerous times: they are fighting against NATO. Ukraine is just &quot;lucky&quot; to be on their way.</p>
<h2>On their way to you.</h2>
<p>Read again: The final goal is you. Your house, your land, your history, your language, your freedom, your values. <strong>Your life.</strong><br />
If we fail to stop russians on Ukrainian soil, someone else (read: you) would have to stop them in Poland, Finland, Baltic states, and finally, on your backyard.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that NATO can defend your land, think if you want to have a burning Russian tank in front of your home:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" alt=""Bucha full of destroyed ru tanks"" /></a></p>
<p>Or a russian missile hits your house. You don't want to guess whether or not it is going to explode, do you?</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Afntk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Afntk.jpg"" alt=""A ru missile hit a house in Derhachi"" /></a></p>
<p>Or if you want to become a &quot;collateral victim&quot; when a KGB terrorist assassinates someone using <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong> in the center of your city.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the UN will express its &quot;deep concern&quot; about the loss of you.<br />
And even once-respected Stack Exchange network would <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/376743/187133"">find nothing better than say</a>, <em>&quot;well, okay, your death is a pity, but it's not a reason to ban the service on russias&quot;</em>.</p>
<h2>Your future depends on your actions <strong>NOW</strong>.</h2>
<p>Would you wait for russians come? Or would you act now?</p>
<ul>
<li>by calling your Senator to ensure more weapons to Ukraine?</li>
<li>by donating to Ukrainian volunteers?</li>
<li>by eliminating <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2je9c4yc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">putinverstehers</a> in your politicum?</li>
<li>or, well, by stopping consuming russian propaganda (incl. reading some users here at SE network)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has to stay together to stop Russian metastasis in Europe as well as the Russian-equipped, Russian-trained, Russian-financed, and Russian-inspired terrorism all over the world.</p>
<p>Please help Ukraine defend you.<br />
Please <strong>Support Ukraine.</strong></p>

<p>Monica Celio should be honourably reinstated with apologies.</p>
<p>Other causes for the strike: SE's blatant dishonesty and &quot;surprises&quot; (licensing, AI); layout (I'm on desktops); ruthless firing of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342039/firing-community-managers-stack-exchange-is-not-interested-in-cooperating-with"">CMs like Shog9 or Robert Cartaino</a>.
In the background: SO -&gt; Quora move, from wanting good answers to wanting many questions.
Most recent: AI-debacle (prompt injects, butchering questions/code, hallucinating facts, generating full questions out of a single letter...)
Also modStrike, but that's positively resolved...</p>

I created some Android apps using Java, got over 50,000 downloads in a couple of them. I finished my Masters in IT in 2014. Since then I've been working in Java, using Spring, micro-services, etc.</p>

<p>I love Java. Some people say it's very verbose and we need to write a lot of lines of code to do simple things. But I like this verbosity. It makes this language look like English language, easy to read and write.</p>

<p>I recently learned React and developed a couple of basic apps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Key issues such as <strong>duplicates are still not resolved</strong>. Measures like <em>not allowing</em> to post duplicates are not implemented; nor a recommender that helps users choose the most appropriate site, or ask better questions. This puts the burden on the frequent users and moderators to keep the site useful. At the same time, duplicates and low-quality questions do cause rude comments and answers in the first place. Solving this properly <em>would</em> likely make the tone much nicer.</li>
<li>Migration of questions is a complicated procedure, rather than simply making the different sites ""views"" on the same underlying data. There is a random set of migrations that can be proposed (such as SO to stats.SE), but no way to propose others (e.g., to DS.SE) They are making our lives harder than necessary.</li>
<li>We can't flag duplicates of questions on other SE sites, even if there is a perfect duplicate.</li>
<li>The company wastes tons of money on stupid things such as WinterBash, and on projects doomed to fail such as ""SO Documentation"" and ""SO for Teams"". I understand that you need to generate more revenue, but you should listen to your users (in particular to avoid <em>costly</em> failures such as documentation).</li>
<li><strong>The company does not listen to their users.</strong> A recent example is the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio"">Monica incident</a>. This lawyeresque statement shows what is wrong: they fight their best users. But there are many more examples. ""User surveys"" that sound like they come from the sales department, not from user support; that avoid any of the big issues such as duplicates, low quality questions, and the resulting sometimes rude handling of such questions; and many more.</li>
<li>I do want to emphasize that I am in general <strong>in favor of a ""code of conduct""</strong>, and I do strongly believe we need to fight for diversity. I am all in favor of using stated pronouns, but I know that I would get them wrong often. I have not seen any of the transcripts, so I have no idea what Monica did, but we also all have heard of false accusations, mistakes, and so on. I do not think the situation was handled well by SO staff, and it only got worse and worse. A code of conduct that are community standards should actually come from the community, and be handled by the community, not by some higher entity like the company.</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/firing-mods-and-forced-relicensing-is-stack-exchange-still-interested-in-cooper"">Firing mods and forced relicensing: is Stack Exchange still interested in cooperating with the community?</a></li>

<p>Screw you moderation, stop closing and (wrongly) editting the posts, leave it to the users to decide if its usefull or not, someone somewhere may find it so, stop acting like nazis(sry insulting you nazis). There is some good mods here, yes there is, but they are few.</p>

<p>About the reputation points and badges, it just turned this site in to a marathon, the faster you are the more points you get, resuming, some ppl started to act like hunters, posting a simple answer to be faster and after editting it to include aditional info, or instead of upvoting the right answer the person just add a somewhat exactly answer, probably trying to get points to, stop being selfish, youre not getting nothing with these virtual points and badges.</p>

<p>The ""mark the answer/solved question"" doesnt work, sometimes the questioner is not sure about the answer or doesnt know there is a better way to do what he asked, then he choses what he finds the right one, this is completly broke for future reference and search.ex: guy ask why his mysql_query(php) is not working, someone help and give the solution, someone else give the solution but recommend using pdo/mysqli, unfortunately he posted a few mins later, guess whos gonna get extra points?</p>

<p>Im probably gonna get banned, well, im gonna come back here anonymously and get the answers i need anyway, and going to help and ask help on forums, the place for real programmers, there you dont have this shit competition/moderation/intolerance.</p>

<p>Upvote, downvote, wathever...this is not going to change my life.</p>

To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease</p>

<p>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy</p>

<p>The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool</p>

<p>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to 
be captured by them</p>

<p>In dispelling ignorance, it is not favorable to act as an enemy</p>

<p>To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune</p>

<p>In punishing folly
It does not further one
To commit transgressions
The only thing that furthers
Is to prevent transgressions</p>

<p>All day long the superior man is creatively active
At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares</p>

<p>If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, he goes astray;
But if he follows, he finds guidance.</p>

<p>The superior man understands the signs of the time and prefers to desist</p>

<p>The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise</p>

<p>You are equal to others, but you are not better</p>

<p>Quiet perseverance brings good fortune</p>

<p>Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs
When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes</p>

<p>Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.</p>

<p>Don't let your heart get big because of your knowledge. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as with the scholar</p>

<p>The greatest epiphany can be lost to the simplest distraction</p>

<p>The surest way to remember something is to give it rhythm</p>

<p>Earnestness is the path of immortality, thoughtlessness the path of death</p>

<p>Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended</p>

<p>And that you remit the debt as alms. That would be better for you if you understand</p>

<p>The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay</p>

<p>It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes</p>

<p>The tools we use have a profound influence on our thinking habits, and therefore, on our thinking abilities</p>

<p>There will never be a universal programming language since no one language is best for all problems</p>

<p>Now I realize that I am the power that commands the feeling of my mind and from which circumstances grow</p>

<p>Remember that man created method, and method did not create man, and do not strain yourself in twisting into someone’s preconceived pattern, which unquestionably would be appropriate for him, but not necessarily for you</p>

<p>What is not subject to choice is fact</p>

<p>It's not that the malicious code <code>understands</code>, they just need to match a pattern</p>

<p>1 &#215; 0; he who falls on this stone will be broken</p>

I have a bunch of code on Google Code, which I guess I should move to GitHub – all the more so since git is my weapon of choice.</p>

<p>I have been working with Lotus (now IBM) <strong>Notes/Domino</strong> since 1996, full-time since the end of 1997.  I have been honored by IBM by being selected as one the <strong>IBM Champions for Collaboration Solutions</strong> since 2014. I have presented at the MWLUG conference in 2015-2017 and CollabSphere in 2019-2020, as well as IBM Connect 2016 and 2017 and IBM Think in 2018.</p>
<p>Since 2016 I have also been working with <strong>NetSuite</strong> and their ERP system. NetSuite uses <strong>SuiteScript</strong> (Javascript with API calls to access database functionality) for development both on the frontend and backend side.</p>
<p>I have been working with HTML and web technologies since early 1994. I have mostly been working with <strong>jQuery and Bootstrap</strong> since about 2013, but I have been using other Javascript frameworks as well.</p>
<p>My main work is currently done using <strong>Javascript</strong> (and <strong>SuiteScript</strong> in NetSuite) as well as <strong>Lotusscript</strong> (a dialect of VB used in IBM Notes/Domino). A couple of years ago I also did some work using C# and .NET, but I don't use it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>My past work experience includes working at <strong>Microsoft AB</strong> in Sweden, and developing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications for Esselte Voice (later VoiceEQ) in Sweden.
In addition I also worked as a journalist for five years covering the IT industry for <strong>International Data Group</strong> (IDG) back in 1993-1998.</p>
<p>More recently I worked at <strong>Deep South Insurance</strong> as a <strong>Sr Application Developer</strong>, focusing mainly on Notes and Domino. I wrote the in-house claim system, as well as several other business critical applications.</p>
<p>My company <strong>Demand Better Solutions</strong> is focused on creating modern looking, easy-to-use applications that will empower the users and make them more efficient. We <strong>modernize Notes and Domino applications</strong>, move them to web applications or migrate data to other platforms.</p>
<p>I started programming in 1982/83, using <strong>BASIC</strong> on Z80-based computers. After about 2 years, I switched to <strong>Pascal</strong>, as my school got new Intel 80186-based computers running <strong>CP/M-86</strong>. In 1988 I started using <strong>C</strong>, first in DOS and then (about a year or two later) in Windows. When <strong>Visual Basic 1.0</strong> came out, I embraced it and added that to my toolbox. I also have past experience using <strong>Paradox</strong> (a database later acquired by Borland), <strong>Delphi</strong> and some <strong>Java</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been blogging since 2008, you can find my blog at <a href=""http://blog.texasswede.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.texasswede.com</a></p>

<p>I have worked with a lot of technologies, from home-computer BASIC and assembly to C to Ruby and JavaScript. I would cautiously say that the language that most excites me currently is Clojure, but I'm open to lots of things.</p>

<p>I like learning about how things from one perspective or paradigm are implemented in another, e.g. object-oriented behavior out of a procedural language like C. The functional worldview seems like one I would be well-served to really take the time to learn and practice.</p>

<p>My day-to-day personal computing setup is in Mac OS X, but I also use a Linux desktop as a backup server and for general tinkering; and I use Windows 7 at work. I feel pretty comfortable in all three.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>Remembering that I'll be dead soon, is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in Life.
Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die, is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hi! I'm Jeff.</strong> I am currently a tech lead on Google Maps Platform (Android, iOS, and Javascript SDKs) in Mountain View, CA, though my opinions and advice are my own. In my personal time, I enjoy lindy hop swing dancing, photography, aviation (as a private pilot), and organizing furry conventions.</p>
<p>Though I like helping with any answers I can, I am found most often on StackOverflow. I particularly like helping debug and explain <strong>Guice</strong>, <strong>Dagger</strong>, and <strong>Mockito</strong>, which I count as some of the most-powerful (and sometimes least-intuitive) packages available in Java today.</p>
<p>My five favorite computer science inventions: Code-generating serialization layers (Protocol Buffers and Thrift), Bloom filters, Hilbert indexes, A* search, and CompactHashSet. I'm also a fan of DI and mocking frameworks, as you can see above. :)</p>

<p>Learning is a long process it takes time and patience. We learn most of the things in schools and universities and then we stop learning. In this competitive world, with lesser jobs than people, there is more to learn than we think. You always need to add a new skill to your resume. There isn’t always going to be someone to teach, we need to be self-directed learners. Don’t wait to learn until you need it, learn to improve. Think like the owner and not the employee, share the profits and not the time.</p>

<p>And I'm always looking for a good algorithm question, because algorithms are fun. The best algorithm is one whose beauty makes you gasp for breath. My lifelong ambition is to have one of those named after me; meanwhile, I collect other people's.</p>

<p>Since I started (a newb fresh out of college) I have learned a massive amount about programming best practices and functionality. I very much have Stack Overflow to thank for a lot of this. I have come to be an avid believer of Stack Exchange and their original goals (goals I think they are accomplishing very well, I might add).</p>

<p>As a programmer, who constantly has to try new things, Stack Overflow has proven an invaluable resource for me. I try, research, try again, delve into old school books, and try again, but when push comes to shove, there are many times when my current level of experience in whatever language, proves inadequate and leaves me scratching my head, so to speak. It seems, that when I am in my darkest hour of coding, Stack Overflow (i.e., the community therein) not only gets me through the problem, but also teaches me how I can handle similar situations in the future, thus always making me a better programmer all around. :)</p>

<p>I enjoy programming more than any other IT related task. Guess that's just who I am, but I suppose I am preaching to the choir here.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2014 where I started my first job for an employer as a Front-end Developer at Divide. Here I spend a little under 5-years building E-commerce sites for Fashion Retail brands and thinking of ways to make their websites more user-friendly, rank higher and have better conversion rates.</p>

After doing a lot of heavy application architecture, design and development in every mainstream platform, I have recently been diving into all the fun, new and exciting UI/UX tools, architectures and design methodologies. It's definitely more fun and less intense than enterprise integrations. </p>

<p>I work primarily as a consultant software engineer. Recently jumped aboard the StackOverflow train and been having fun helping out the community any chance I get.</p>

programming is a hobby.
Recently re-discovered Delphi after recovering from a severe trauma.
SO has been a great resource to find my way back.</p>

<p>My current project is an Email Client.
The main reason for this is to help a customer who needs to perform regular mail-outs to various large groups.
Tedious job so I built an automated program to send a saved email message (*.eml)
using a csv file of recipients.
In supporting this customer, which is not my normal function,
I just clean out viruses, re-install os/apps and replace bad PC parts.. (Monkey work),
I realised that certain functions to manage contacts in email-clients were missing, especially when managing large groups and wanting to send large mail-outs.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to see if I could make a simple email client that would allow a user more extensive capabilities to manage contact groups and mail-outs on the Keep It Simple Syndrome (KISS) principle. <em>ha, the what now??? - easier said than done; funny enough</em>
Lots of problems to work out,i.e learn how-tos, to achieve something we all take for granted.
So far, I have a working fully functional HTML editor/viewer thanks to BSALSA - EmbeddedWB; with a slight modification allowing full access to the MSHTML editor. way cool :)
Now working on message and contact database management, i.e how-to-use DB controls and a good method to manage contact Groups/folders/tables, allowing full control and easy sorting, searching and batch mail-outs.</p>

<p>Delphi (Pascal) is a programming language that seems to have adhered to that principle very well. Brings back memories as Pascal was the first language I was taught in High School in the '80s.</p>

<p>Happy Delphiing :)</p>

<h2>Project 1: The Sphere</h2>
<p>The mission of <em>The Sphere</em> is to promote self-refection, the respect to others, the curiosity to what causes fear, and the courage to cut harmful things. The targets are people who are suffering (or creating suffering to others), yet resist others' supports to maintain status quo. This includes abusers and people who developed a worldview to justify their learned helplessness. The method is to equip their friends and loved ones the skills and knowledge to help them change their mind. For starter, read about <a href=""https://www2.slideshare.net/esahakyan/integrated-social-services-reaching-the-most-vulnerable-training-package-for-case-managers-16096590"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">social work case management</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consequentialism</a>.</p>
<p>Protectors of autonomy usually have a misconception that one's choice should always be respected, because their autonomy should always be respected. The fact is that it is only true in 99.999999% of cases, and the other 0.0000001% is people who internalized oppression. Therefore, only hoping for the best but leaving their situation intact is generally considered as undermining their autonomy. For starter, read about <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relational autonomy</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decision-making capacity</a>.</p>
<p>This project is written in Vietnamese. <a href=""https://xn--qucu-hr5aza.com/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Other%20sites%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=Homepage&amp;utm_campaign=Homepage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Its website</a> attracted ~30k people in past year (~160 on average per day). Many of them are human right activists, psychologists, religion practitioners, academic researchers, artists, etc.</p>
<h2>Project 2: A theory of perspective</h2>
<p>Imagine a floating iceberg. The part above the water is the <em>The Sphere</em> project. The part below the water is this project. It is to construct a theory for the concept &quot;perspective&quot;, as in &quot;keep a fresh perspective&quot;, &quot;look at the problem in a new perspective&quot;, &quot;put yourself in other's perspective&quot;, etc. The concept is intuitive, but exactly what it is is still vague. Because of that, these advices are easier said than done. The take-home message is this &quot;formula&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>

I was warned not to touch any of it, <em>under threat of broken fingers.</em> ...so naturally I messed with it, repeatedly (what can I say, I was like 5 or 6 years old), and invariably I'd fuck something up, but (motivated by pure fear) I'd always somehow manage to figure out how to &quot;fix&quot; it before he came home.
